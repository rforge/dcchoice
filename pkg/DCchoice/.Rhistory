## The variable answers are converted into a format that is suitable for the
## function dbchoice() as follows:
NaturalPark$R1 <- ifelse(substr(NaturalPark$answers, 1, 1) == "y", 1, 0)
NaturalPark$R2 <- ifelse(substr(NaturalPark$answers, 2, 2) == "y", 1, 0)
## We assume that the error distribution in the model is a
## log-logistic; therefore, the bid variables bid1 is converted
## into LBD1 as follows:
NaturalPark$LBD1 <- log(NaturalPark$bid1)
## Further, the variables bidh and bidl are integrated into one
## variable (bid2) and the variable is converted into LBD2 as follows:
NaturalPark$bid2 <- ifelse(NaturalPark$R1 == 1, NaturalPark$bidh, NaturalPark$bidl)
NaturalPark$LBD2 <- log(NaturalPark$bid2)
## The utility difference function is assumed to contain covariates (sex, age, and
## income) as well as two bid variables (LBD1 and LBD2) as follows:
fmdb <- R1 + R2 ~ sex + age + income | LBD1 + LBD2
## Not run:
## The formula may be alternatively defined as
fmdb <- R1 + R2 ~ sex + age + income | log(bid1) + log(bid2)
## End(Not run)
## The function dbchoice() with the function fmdb and the dataframe
## NP is executed as follows:
NPdb <- dbchoice(fmdb, data = NaturalPark)
NPdb
NPdbs <- summary(NPdb)
NPdbs
## The confidence intervals for these WTPs are calculated using the
## function krCI() or bootCI() as follows:
## Not run:
krCI(NPdb)
bootCI(NPdb)
a <- rnorm(5)
sort(a)
